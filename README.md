# Image Classification Project
This project implements an image classification system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with PyTorch. The goal is to develop and evaluate an image classification model based on a pre-trained backbone, such as ResNet-18, and to experiment with different preprocessing techniques, augmentation, loss functions and optimizers to obtain the best results.

We have retrieved a vehicle image classification dataset from Kaggle that contains images of four different types of vehicles: car, truck, bus and motorcycle.
